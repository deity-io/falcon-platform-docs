## Projects
Depending on the number of projects your organization is managing in the Deity Platform, you’ll see a list of projects to choose from, or you’ll directly see the specific project dashboard you’ve been granted access to. Read more >

### Platform usage
For each organization project, Deity offers pre-paid subscriptions that include a large number of GraphQL client requests. Once you go over this threshold, you’ll be billed surcharges separately based on the number of incoming client requests. Read more >

### Environments
For each project, Deity offers three Deity Cloud environments to start with; Test, acceptance & production. If you need more environments for your project, you can always request more. Read more >

### Builds
A build is a full build of a particular commit. This is not accessible unless it's deployed. Having builds for each of your commits means it's near instant to update your environments.

### Deployments
Deployments are when a build has been pushed to an environment.
