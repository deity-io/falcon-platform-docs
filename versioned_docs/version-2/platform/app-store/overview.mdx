As you might know, DEITY's PWA allows you to build and maintain one single web application that can be used on almost any device. There might be some cases however where customers are migrating from, or still running native applications, in which case a direct alternative might come in handy.

However, it has been said that it is not possible to publish PWA's into the Apple App Store. We took that as a challenge and **we've made it possible!**

We've published our demo PWA theme as a native app to the App Store. If you want to take a look yourself, feel free to check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/deity-storefront/id1585832328).

If you are interested in publishing your project to the App Store, please [reach out to us](https://deity.io/contact)
