By default you can use three environments per project. If you need more environments for your development, you can request an additional environment. Depending on the requirements, we will then configure the new environment to your needs.

### Build & Deploy
Each environment can be used to deploy your created Deity apps to. So every time you push changes to your Git repository, Deity Cloud will receive a signal from your Git provider and starts building the Deity app. When the build is successfully completed, you can select it to deploy it to one of your environments. 

### Domains
Every environment uses an internal Deity Cloud URL, something along the line of

https://21d9d456-1eab-243f-82de-3afcd99b661f-acceptance.eu.prd.c.deity.cloud

You can always access the internal URL for review and development purposes. Additionally, you can set multiple custom domains per environment. For instance, you want to use https://brandname.webshopname.com to point to one of the environments. You can set this in the Storefront > Domains section.
