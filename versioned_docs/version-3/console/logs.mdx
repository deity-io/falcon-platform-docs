The log explorer enables you to scrutinize and interrogate the logs produced by your remote Composer and Storefront applications. The logs displayed are relevant to the environment you have chosen, which you can switch using the dropdown menu in the top navigation. Please bear in mind that only the logs emanating from remote environments are visible in your console; logs from local applications executed on your machine will not appear here. For local development, you can utilize our CLI tool to inspect logs.
