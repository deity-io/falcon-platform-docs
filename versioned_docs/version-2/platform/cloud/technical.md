## How does DEITY Platform Cloud work?

Cloud uses Google web services to provide a scalable and geo appropriate hosting solution for your app.

## Terminology

### Build
A build is a full build of a particular commit. This is not accessible unless it's deployed. Having builds for each of your commits means it's near instant to update your environments.

### Deployments
Deployments are when a build has been pushed to an environment.

### Environments
The number of environments available depends on your Cloud plan. An environment is a complete infrastructure with an accessible URL.

### Repositories
This refers to the code repository for your site.
