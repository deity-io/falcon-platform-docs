## Create Falcon App

To generate a new application based on DEITY Platform you can use our CLI tool, **create falcon app**.

:::note Using the new themes?
The old theme will, by default, be connected to our demo **Magento 2** and **Wordpress** instances.

By default the demo based on "demo-v2" assumes it's connected to a **BigCommerce** instance, which uses **Algolia** and **Stripe**. Without these credentials the application will not start (you'll see the errors in the console). 

By default the demo based on "demo-v3" assumes it's connected to a **CommerceTools** and **Contentful** instances. Without these credentials the application will not start (you'll see the errors in the console). 
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app@beta <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create @deity/falcon-app@beta <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate a Falcon site into a directory with the name of your projects (`<project-name>`).

**Regular Project** 
```
project-name/
 |- client
```

**Enterprise / Full Project** 
```
project-name/
 |- client
 |- server
```

### Options

- **`--example <name-of-example>`** The example flag is used to define which example we want to start with. The options are `demo-v1`(default), `demo-v2` and `demo-v3`.

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app@beta --example demo-v2 <project-name>
```

- **`--full`** To generate **DEITY Middleware** use the `--full` flag. You will only be able to deploy DEITY Middleware changes if you're on an Enterprise plan.


```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app@beta --full <project-name>
```

## Configuring DEITY PWA Frontend

:::note Running DEITY Middleware Locally?
If you're an Enterprise customer and running DEITY Middleware locally you can skip this step and connect to DEITY Middleware using the default settings.
:::

Before you can start your app you'll need to configure DEITY PWA Frontend to point to DEITY Middleware. 

### 1. Create a local.json file

Create a `local.json` file in your `client/config/` direcotry. This file is ignored by `git` and should **not** be committed. 

### 2. Add your details.

Add the following code to your `local.json` file, replacing `[YOUR_SITE_URL]` with your site URL.

```json
  
{
  "graphqlUrl": "[YOUR_SITE_URL]/graphql",
}
```

## Starting your app

### Sandbox / Production customers

To get your app started you'll need to start (and keep running) **DEITY PWA Frontend**.

In a terminal window go into the client directory (`cd client/`) and run the start command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once these have started, visit <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:3000</a> to see your app.

## Configuring DEITY Middleware

If you're on an Enterprise plan and have access to **DEITY Middleware** you may also want to run this locally. 

In order to do so you might want (depending on the demo you used to generate the application) provide required credentials:

- BigCommerce, Algolia and Stripe for `demo-v2`

- CommerceTools and Contentful `demo-v3`

###  1. Create a local.json file

To create the configuration we advise to create file `server/config/local.json`
That way file with configuration won't be tracked by git, as `local.json` is ignored in .gitignore. Thanks to that secrets and sensitive data will never be stored in git.

### 2. Add required configuration

To provide all required configuration options copy the required sections from `server/config/default.json` and place these in `server/config/local.json`. Content from that file will be merged with the `default.json`. 

You can find more information about the way configuration works in [Configuraiton section](../server-v3/configuration)

### Starting DEITY Middleware

By default **DEITY Middleware** runs on `http://localhost:4000` and uses `http://localhost:4000/graphql` for it's graphQl endpoint.

As well as having **DEITY PWA Frontend** running you'll need to open a new terminal window and run the start command in the `server` directory.

**Server**

cd server/
