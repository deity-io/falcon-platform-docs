###### Release Date (2021-03-09)

## Breaking Changes 💥

- Add normalised order status mapping to both the BigCommerce and Magento 2 API packages (`@deity/falcon-magento-api` + `@deity/falcon-bigcommerce-api`)
- Update Mollie Plugin to contain 2 core components, `MolliePlugin` and `MollieCardPlugin`. There is no longer a default export for `@deity/falcon-mollie-plugin`.

## New Features 🚀

- Add support for native Magento search (`@deity/falcon-magento-api`)
- Add search components to demo v1
- Add support for [redirects](/platform/redirects/overview)
- Add support for blog 'pages'

## Bug Fixes 🐛

- Fix cart restoration for failed or cancelled payments (`@deity/falcon-bigcommerce-api`)
- Fix issues with BigCommerce orders automatically being archived (`@deity/falcon-bigcommerce-api`)
- Fix missing ApolloClient Link (`@deity/falcon-client`)
- Clear shipping method in `CheckoutProvider` when billing address is changed to line up with the session data (`@deity/front-kit`)
- Add missing Mollie ENV vars into demo v1
- Refunds now only send totals rather than item data to Falcon Payments to avoid issues with totals not adding up when discounts are applied. (`@deity/falcon-magento-api` + `@deity/falcon-bigcommerce-api`)

## Polish 💅

- Add a sanity check into all order webhooks to prevent collisions when multiple apps are using the same BigCommerce store (`@deity/falcon-bigcommerce-api`)
- Pass proper httpLink configuration to `getApolloClientUploadLink()` (`@deity/falcon-client`)

## Upgrade Notes 📝

- [ENTERPRISE ONLY] We've noticed on some installations an error caused by clashing `node-fetch` versions. To fix this run `npx yarn-deduplicate` & `yarn install` in the `server` directory.
- [ENTERPRISE ONLY] the lines below can be removed from your `server/index.js` file because these have been moved into our `@deity/falcon-server` package.

```js
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.log('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise', promise, 'reason:', reason);
});
process.on('uncaughtException', ex => {
  console.log('Uncaught Exception: ', ex);
});
```
