Navigate to Settings > Codebase to find your npm token. In order to access the Deity packages, you will connect to the private npm registry using this token. We recommend adding your token to a user config, it can however be added in your projects root.

You'll need to either create or edit a `.npmrc` file. The user config can be found in your users root directory `~/.npmrc`. If you don't have one, you can create one:


```bash
nano ~/.npmrc
```

Add the npm token to your `.npmrc` file, for example:


```bash
@deity:registry=https://npm.deity.io
//npm.deity.io/:_authToken=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

You can test whether it is configured correctly by running the following command, which will output the list of available version of our demo app creation.


```bash
npm view @deity/create-falcon-app
```
