## Mollie Configuration

The easiest way to configure Mollie is by using `dcloud` CLI and the `dcloud payments:provider:configure` command. If you want to configure it manually, this can be achieved using [this endpoint â†’](https://dpsg.deity.cloud/#/Management/EnvironmentPaymentProviderController_mollie_create)


```json
{
  "profileId": "string", // Private
  "apiKey": "string", // Private
  "testMode": "boolean"
}
```

To get your profile ID &amp; API key you must have a [Mollie account](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/).  Please ensure `testMode` is set to true when using test credentials.
