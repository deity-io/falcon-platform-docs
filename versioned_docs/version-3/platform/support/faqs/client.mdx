<Accordion title="Can I use NextJS">
  Unfortunately, Deity PWA & Native Storefronts (the frontend app) cannot be used together with NextJs. NextJs uses its own
  template/routing system, which is incompatible with ours. However, Deity Commerce Composer (data/graphql server app) could be used as a
  middleware between your backend and your NextJS frontend.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I access configuration values?">
  This works differently for Deity PWA & Native Storefronts and Deity Commerce Composer. Configuration information can be found{' '}
  <Link to="/docs/storefront/getting-started/configuration">here</Link>.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Offline support doesn't seem to be working">
  Our service worker, that provides offline support is only used in production mode. If you're running your app in
  development `yarn start` rather than `yarn start:prod` offline mode won't work.
