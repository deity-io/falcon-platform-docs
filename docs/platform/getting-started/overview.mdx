## Basic setup steps

Getting started with Falcon Platform can be broken down into a few simple steps.

1. [Create a Falcon Platform account](prerequisites)
2. [Get access to our private NPM packages](npm)
3. [Create and configure your app](create)
4. [Create and configure your code repository](repository)
5. [Install DCloud to manage deployments and environments](/docs/platform/cloud/installation)

Once you've finished those steps you're ready to start developing and [deploying](/docs/platform/deployment/overview) your app.

Some of our instructions are a little different for Enterprise plans, which use their own version of Falcon Server.
