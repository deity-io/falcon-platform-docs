Our cloud platform will need access to your code repository.  We use an **SSH key** for access and **web hooks** to allow us to watch for code changes.

We currently support <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitBucket</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitLab</a>.

We'll only need **read access** to your repo.

## Getting your details

You can get your **SSH key** and **web hook** details 2 ways.

### 1. Admin Panel

If you're using our BigCommerce integration your details these details can be found there.


### 2. Using DCloud

[DCloud](/docs/platform/cloud/installation) is our CLI tool that is used to help you manage your deployments and environments.  Your **SSH key** and **web hook** details can be found here.

Simply run the following command from a terminal window when logged into `dcloud`:

```bash
dcloud repo -i
```
