## What is Falcon Platform Cloud

Cloud is an infrastructure that allows you to host your <a href="https://deity.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Falcon site</a>.

Cloud will scale automatically depending on your needs and traffic, meaning your site is always **blazing fast**.

Depending on your plan you'll be able to have as many environments as you need making it easy to test new features before putting them live.

Built with internationalization in mind, Cloud supports multi-region based on geolocation.
