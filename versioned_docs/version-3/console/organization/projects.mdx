Your projects are provisioned by Deity. In the overview you can see the list of your projects, the amount of available environments and which region your environments are housed in.

:::info Note
Depending on the user role you’re assigned to, you can request a new project or environment for your organization.
:::

### New project
Fill in the new project name, the contact email that we can use to contact for further provisioning and the platform version you’re planning to use for your new project.

### Additional environments
You can request additional environments, for example an extra development environment to suit your workflow, via the home screen of your project.

The project region is applicable to all environments. Available options at this moment are `Europe (EU-W4)`, `United States (US-C1)` or `Australia (AU-SE1)`. You can request a migration of your project region via our customer support.
