Payment providers all handle payments in different ways meaning every integration will be a little different. Because of this `@deity/falcon-payments` tries to be as indiscriminate as possible.

There are 3 main parts involved involved in the payment process:

- A [Payment Provider](provider) registered in your server config
- A [Payment UI](ui) that is mapped to a provider
- Payment service provider API (Stripe, Braintree, PayPal etc)

## Payment Flow Steps

import HighlightFlag from '../../../src/components/HighlightFlag';

1. <HighlightFlag text="Payment Provider" /> Account / API keys created

2. <HighlightFlag type="server" /> Payment provider created and configured in config files.

3. <HighlightFlag type="client" /> Client side UI component created (payment form)

4. <HighlightFlag type="client" /> Client side component mapped to provider

5. <HighlightFlag type="client" /> Client side component initiated

6. <HighlightFlag type="server" /> Triggers `initiate` method in payment provider. Authentication requested

7. <HighlightFlag text="Payment Provider" /> Token / Auth info returned

8. <HighlightFlag type="server" /> PSP auth pushed to client side component

9. <HighlightFlag type="client" /> User triggers payment (fills in form and submits)

10. <HighlightFlag type="server" /> Triggers `validate` method in payment provider

11. <HighlightFlag text="Payment Provider" /> Payment handled

12. <HighlightFlag type="server" /> Payment response handled

## Payment Flow Diagram

This is a general overview of how payments work in the Falcon Platform checkout. All payment service providers are different, as are all implementations so this may vary slightly for you.
