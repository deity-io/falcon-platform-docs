As you might know, Deity's PWA allows you to build and maintain one single **web** application that can be used on almost any device. There might be some cases however where customers are migrating from, or still running **native** applications, in which case a direct (native) alternative might come in handy.

It has been said that it is not possible to publish PWA's into the Apple App Store. We took that as a challenge and **we've succeeded!**

We've published our demo PWA theme as a native app to the App Store. If you want to take a look yourself, feel free to check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/deity-storefront/id1585832328).

## Features

Our PWA in App Store allows you to utilise all the native iOS app functionalities. Such features include, among others, being able to receive push notifications and access to core data and the device's accelerometer.
