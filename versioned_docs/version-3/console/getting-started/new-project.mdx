Depending on the number of projects your organization is managing in the Deity Platform, you’ll see a list of projects to choose from, or you’ll directly see the specific project dashboard you’ve been granted access to.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how projects are organised in Deity Platform, you can start building your digital experiences with Deity Composer and additional Deity building blocks.

Please follow these three simple steps to connect your codebase with the selected Deity project and Deity Cloud powered CI/CD pipeline.
