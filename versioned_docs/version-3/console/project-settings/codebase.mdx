If you’ve followed the [Getting Started](../getting-started/new-project) instructions, you’ve successfully set-up your Deity project and connected it to your Git repository.

## Npm
Follow the instructions to configure npm access on your local machine. 

### Access Deity’s npm packages
Navigate to **Settings → Codebase** to find your npm token. In order to access the Deity packages, you will connect to the private npm registry using this token. We recommend adding your token to a user config, it can however be added in your projects root.

You'll need to either create or edit a `.npmrc` file. The user config can be found in your users root directory `~/.npmrc`. If you don't have one, you can create one:

```bash
nano ~/.npmrc
```

Add the npm token to your `.npmrc` file, for example:


```bash
@deity:registry=https://npm.deity.io
//npm.deity.io/:_authToken=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```

You can test whether it is configured correctly by running the following command, which will output the list of available version of our demo app creation.


```bash
npm view @deity/create-falcon-app
```

### Git repository
Once you’ve created a new Deity project on your local machine, you can push this to your repository of choice. We currently support GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

If you’ve already set up a webhook in your Git repository provider and pushed your code to your repository, it will have triggered the detection of your repository. You’ll see it listed after that. For example:

```bash
git@github.com:deity-io/deity-falcon-cloud-example-app.git
```

#### Setting up for the first time
To link your repository to the Deity platform and enable automatic build creation, you’ll need to configure read access on the repository, and a webhook to notify Deity of push events.

1. Copy the SSH key, and add it as a read-only deploy key to your repository.

2. Next up, you’ll want to copy the webhook URL. Add it to your repository, set the content type to application/json and select the git push event to trigger the webhook.

3. You can test if the configuration was successful by pushing your code to the repository. You should see your repository name appear in the console, as well as a new build.
