You’ll probably use one or more payment service providers to facilitate the payments processing between you as a merchant and your shoppers. Using the Deity payment gateway, you can connect to any of our supported payment service providers and start routing payments to them based on your configuration.

The Deity payment gateway does not process any payments on your behalf. Instead, it is the unifying proxy layer between your Composer and the various payment providers. No sensitive payment and/or cardholder data is stored on Deity infrastructure.

We currently support the following payment service providers. Click on one of them to see its dedicated documentation page:

Mollie

Adyen

Stripe

Wpay

Humm

Deity Sandbox

Once you’ve entered the required credentials, you can select which countries and currencies should be accepted for this provider. The selection you make here, will impact all the methods you’ll configure later on. Select a list of countries and currencies, or select ANY if you want to accept any currency or country.

You can toggle the enabled flag to decide whether or not to enable the provider in your checkout. Use this to quickly turn off providers entirely, or turn them back on.
