## Getting started with Commercetools
To get started with Commercetools, you can follow their tutorials and explore their platform.

- [Getting started](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/getting-started)
- [Commercetools HTTP API documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts)

Deity's integration makes use of Commercetools' Typescript SDK. You can the documentation and repository here:

- [Commercetools TypeScript SDK Client V2 documentation](https://commercetools.github.io/nodejs/sdk/api/typescriptSdk.html#typescript-sdk-client-v2)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sdk-typescript)

## Commercetools Postman Collection
Commercetools provides a Postman collection containing examples of requests and responses for most endpoints and commands. For every command the smallest possible payload is given, optional fields can be found in the [API documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts).

To get started with the Postman collection, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Create an API key

In your Commercetools dashboard you'll need to create a new API key that has permissions to `manage_types`. Save these credentials for a later step.

:::note Create a new key
We recommend creating a new key for this action so you can't reduce the permissions needed for your main API key used by the Deity application.

### 2. Download and install the [Postman client](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
### 3. Download sample Postman collections

Commercetools have a handy repository containing `JSON` collection files you can import directly into Postman.

[https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-postman-collection/tree/master/api](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-postman-collection/tree/master/api)

Please download and import these.

### 4. Add your credentials

The collections from step 1 required you to add some credentials as Postman variables. You can set these variables in the `Variables` tab of the collection. These variables are from **step 1**:

- `auth_url`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `project-key`
- `host`

### 5. Authorize your requests

If you completed **step 4** you should be able to run the request `Authorization -> Obtain access token`. This will create an access token and save it as a Postman variable for later requests.

If the token is not saved automatically, you can manually save the access token as the `ctp_access_token` variable of the collection.
