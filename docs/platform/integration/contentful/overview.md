## Overview

This module provides Contentful API resolvers for the `@deity/falcon-blog-extension` package. Please read this documentation carefully since all of the steps has to be completed for a smooth integration. Basically 2 actions are required and described in the following documentation;

1. Update the configuration of Falcon Server - see the [Getting started](./getting-started) section for that
2. Add our set of Contentful Content Models - see the section [Content models](./content-models) section for that
