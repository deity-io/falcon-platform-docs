<Accordion title="Can I use NextJS">
  Unfortunately, Falcon-Client (the frontend app) cannot be used together with NextJs. NextJs uses its own
  template/routing system, which is incompatible with ours. Falcon-Server (data/graphql server app) could be used as a
  middleware between Spree backend and your frontend. It could be even used to provide data for your NextJs frontend
  (depending on how you want to organize your whole setup).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I access configuration values?">
  This works differently for Falcon Client and Falcon Server. Configuration information can be found{' '}
  <Link to="/platform/configuration/overview">here</Link>.

<Accordion title="Offline support doesn't seem to be working...">
  Our service worker, that provides offline support is only used in production mode. If you're running your app in
  development `yarn start` rather than `yarn start:prod` offline mode won't work.
