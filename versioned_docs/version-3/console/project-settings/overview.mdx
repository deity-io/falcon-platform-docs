# Projects

Your projects are provisioned by Deity. On the homepage you can see the list of your projects, the amount of available environments and which region your environments are housed in. If you are currently working on one project, you'll see the details of your project.

import Notice from "../../includes/console-user-role.mdx";

<Notice />


## New project
You can request a new project from both the homepage and your organization page. Click **New project** and fill in the new project name, the contact email that we can use to contact for further provisioning and the platform version youâ€™re planning to use for your new project.

## Project settings
In the settings page you can set your project name and review the project key and the region your project is running. If you want to change the region, you can contact our Sales Team.
