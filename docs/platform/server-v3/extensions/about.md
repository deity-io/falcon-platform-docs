Falcon-Server provides its own base GraphQL Schema, that defines data types, queries
and mutations, so every Extension could use its types and extend them.

Currently, DEITY provides the following list of officially supported extensions:

- [Shop Extension](./blog-extension)
- [Blog Extension](./shop-extension)

Each of these can of course be extended with custom features that are specific for particular implementation.
