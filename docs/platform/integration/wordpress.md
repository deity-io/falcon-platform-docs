## Overview

Our Wordpress integration comes with both our examples apps, `demo-v1` and `demo-v2`.

It works using our Wordpress Plugin to extend and add API endpoints.

## Supported Features

Our plugin adds endpoints for many of Wordpresses features including posts, tags, comments, media and more. We also support menus and `Advanced Custom Fields`.

Using `demo-v1` we have full support (including components and routes) for the following features:

- Blog Posts
- Blog Categories

See our [demo](https://demo.deity.io/blog).


## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have a wordpress instance up and running.

### 2. Install our plugin

Now you must install our Wordpress Plugin. If you download the code into your `plugins` directory you should then be able to **activate** it in the admin.

If it's working you should see our handy 'Clean API cache' button in your admin panel.

### 3. Create your Falcon app

Using `create-falcon-app` you now need to create a falcon instance. We recommend using `demo-v2` as a starting point.

### 4. Add your Wordpress configuration

All you need to do is add your sites URL and you're away.

```json
{
  "apis": {
    "wordpress": {
      "config": {
        "host": "[SITE_URL_WITHOUT_PROTOCOL]",
        "protocol": "[PROTOCOL]",
        "apiPrefix": "/wp-json/wp/v2"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### 5. Finished

That's it. If you're using our example app (`demo-v2`) then you should see your latest posts appear on your Falcon Platform apps homepage.
