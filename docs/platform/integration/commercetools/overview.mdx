## Introduction

Commercetools is a headless e-commerce platform built on MACH principles (microservice-based, API-first, cloud-native and headless).

- [Commercetools Website](https://commercetools.com/)

Before you get started, we recommend reading the [developer resources of Commercetools](/next/platform/integration/commercetools/resources) to understand the core concepts.

Once familiar with Commercetools, start the integration by [configuring your Falcon Middleware](/next/platform/integration/commercetools/configuration/getting-started).

If you reach a point where it is necessary for you to extend our integration, you can have a look at the [documentation](/next/platform/integration/commercetools/extending/getting-started).
