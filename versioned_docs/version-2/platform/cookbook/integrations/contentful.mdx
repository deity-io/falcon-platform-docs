In this tutorial we will implement a **basic** integration with <a href="https://www.contentful.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contentful</a>.

Contentful provide a few ways to get data, including **GraphQL**. In this tutorial we will be using **REST** as it's included in all their plans.

:::note Read this first
We recommend you go through [the json placeholder](jsonplaceholder) example first as it explains the basics of writing an extension and we will be skipping past a few details.
:::

## Overview

We will get 'course' information from <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Contentfuls</a> example data. 

We will be explaining how to add API auth details to your DEITY Cloud instances and to your `server/config/local.json` file.

## 1. Getting set up with Contentful

### i. Create an account

If you don't already have a Contentful you'll have to create one. This is easy and they have free plans if you're just testing it out.

### ii. Set up your content model

This tutorial focuses on getting a **course** content model. This comes as part of their example data.  If you're not using this model a few details later on may vary.

### iii. Add some content entries

Once you've got your content model setup you'll need to add some content. Again we are using the sample data that comes with 2 'courses' ('Hello Contentful' & 'Hello SDKs').

### iiii. Get your credentials

The last thing you'll need to do on Contentfuls side is get your credentials.

You'll need your:

- Content Delivery API key
- Space ID
- Environment ID
- Content Type ID

You can get all of these from your admin.

![contentful admin](/img/docs/platform/contentful-admin.png)

You can get your `Content Delivery API Key` and `Space ID` from the API keys section in your dashboard.

Your `Environment ID` from the environments section. If you're using sample data, this is **master**.

To get your `Content Type ID` go to your content model and it will be in the sidebar. Using the sample data it will be **course**.

## 2. Creating your API and Extension packages

:::note Want to test your API outside of Falcon Platform?
Contentful have a really handy <a href="https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/content-types/content-type/get-a-single-content-type/console" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">API testing tool</a> as part of their docs meaning you don't need to use a tool like <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Postman</a>.
:::

[The json placeholder](jsonplaceholder) example covers this section in more detail.

### i. Create your extension and API files

You'll need to create the following files:

```bash
|-server
  |-config
    local.json (this might already exist)
  |-src
    |-falcon-content-extension
      index.js
      schema.graphql
    |-falcon-contentful-api
      index.js
```

### ii. Register you API and extension 

These are registered in your `server/config/default.json`. Remember the api passed to the extension must match the name defined in the api, in this case `contentful`.

**`server/config/default.json`**
```json
{
  ...
  "apis": {
    ...
    "contentful": {
      "package": "./src/falcon-contentful-api/index.js",
      "config": {
        "host": "cdn.contentful.com",
        "protocol": "https"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    ...
    "falcon-content-extension": {
      "package": "./src/falcon-content-extension",
      "config": {
        "api": "contentful"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### iii. Create your extension

**`server/src/falcon-content-extension/index.js`**
```js
module.exports = () => ({});
```

**`server/src/falcon-content-extension/schema.graphql`**
```js
extend type Query {
  courses: Courses! @cache(ttl: 15)
}

type Courses {
  items: [Course]
}

type Course {
  fields: CourseData
}

type CourseData {
  title: String
  description: String
}
```

**n.b.** We're only adding `title` and `description` to the course for now. You could of course add what ever fields you need.

### iiii. Create your API files

**`server/src/falcon-contentful-api/index.js`**
```js
const { ApiDataSource } = require('@deity/falcon-server-env');

module.exports = class ContentfulApi extends ApiDataSource {

 async courses() {
    const { environment, spaceId, contentDeliveryApi } = this.config;
    const query = {
      access_token: contentDeliveryApi,
      content_type: 'course'
    };
    const data = await this.get(`/spaces/${spaceId}/environments/${environment}/entries`, query);
    const courseCollection = JSON.parse(data);
  
    const { items } = courseCollection;

    return {
      items
    };
  }
};
```

Notice we're pulling details from our **config** (`const { environment, spaceId, contentDeliveryApi } = this.config;`). 

`this.config` has access to anything passed in `config: {}` in your json file. We've noted added `environment`, `spaceId` or `contentDeliveryApi` yet but will in the next section.

The `content_type` const should be your **Content Type ID**, in our case it's **course**.

## 3. Adding your credentials locally

We don't want to commit our API keys so, for now we'll add these to a `server/config/local.json`. This is merged into your `default.json` but not committed ([see this doc for more information](/docs/platform/client/configuration)).

The name of the API needs to be the same as in `server/config/default.json`. In this case it's `contentful`.

**`server/config/local.json`**
```json
{
  ...
  "apis": {
    "contentful": {
      "config": {
        "spaceId": "[SPACE_ID]",
        "contentDeliveryApi": "[CONTENT_DELIVERY_API]",
        "environment": "[ENVIRONMENT_ID]"
      }
    }
  },
}

```

## 4. Testing your GraphQL

You're now ready to test your extension. Make sure `falcon-server` is up and running.

To use this tool it must be running on port `4000` (`http://localhost/4000/graphql`).

     sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
   ></iframe>


## 5. Using your data in Falcon Client

As before, this section is largely covered in [the json placeholder](jsonplaceholder) example.

We will need to create the following files in `client`.

```bash
|-client
  |-src
    |-components
      |- Course
        index.js
        CourseList.js
        CourseListQuery.js
```

`client/src/components/Course/index.js` is just used to export the other files.

**`client/src/components/Course/index.js`**
```js
export * from './CourseList';
export * from './CourseListQuery';
```

### i. Get your data

**`client/src/components/Course/CourseListQuery.js`**
```js
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { Query } from '@deity/falcon-data';

const GET_COURSE_LIST = gql`
  query CourseList {
    course {
      items {
        fields {
          title
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

export class TodoListQuery extends Query {
  static defaultProps = {
    query: GET_COURSE_LIST
  };
}
```

### ii. Use your data

**`client/src/components/Course/CourseList.js`**
```js
import React from 'react';
import { CourseListQuery } from './CourseListQuery';

export const CourseList = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <CourseListQuery>
        {({ data: { course = {} } }) => {
          const { items = [] } = course;
          if (items.length) {
            const courseItems = items.map(item => {
              const { fields } = item;
              return (
                <li>
                  <h3>{fields.title}</h3>
                  <p>{fields.description}</p>
                </li>
              );
            });

            return <ul>{courseItems}</ul>;
          }
          return null;
        }}
      </CourseListQuery>
    </>
  );
};
```

Now you've created your `<CourseList>` component, if you want to see it on the frontend you'll need to include it somewhere.

## 6. Moving your credentials to your environment

In [step 3](#3-adding-your-credentials-locally) we added our API keys to our `config/local.json` file. This isn't committed so won't work anywhere other than locally.

To use this config on a remote environment we will want to use a `server/config/custom-environment-variables.json` file.

Learn about our config files [here](/docs/platform/client/configuration).

### i. Add our aliases to custom-environment-variables.json

In this file we add aliases for config variables. To avoid collisions we've prefixed ours with `CONTENTFUL`. 

```json
{
  ...
  "apis": {
    "contentful": {
      "config": {
        "spaceId": "CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID",
        "contentDeliveryApi": "CONTENTFUL_CONTENT_DELIVERY_API",
        "environment": "CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
      }
    }
  },
}
```

### ii. Set our variable values on the server.

If you're using DEITY Cloud then this is very easy, [see](/docs/platform/cloud/dcloud#environment-variable).

Log into your cloud box and run the following command.

```bash
dcloud env:var <env> <name> [value]
```

In our case...

```bash
dcloud env:var production CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT_ID master
dcloud env:var production CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID [your id here]
dcloud env:var production CONTENTFUL_CONTENT_DELIVERY_API [your api key here]
```

## 7. Finished

That's it, you now have a **basic** integration with Contentful. Contentful is a really powerful tool and the integration possibilities are endless but the principle should always remain the same.

Happy coding.
