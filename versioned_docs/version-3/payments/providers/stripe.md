## Stripe Configuration

The easiest way to configure Stripe is by using `dcloud` CLI and the `dcloud payments:provider:configure` command. If you want to configure it manually, this can be achieved using [this endpoint â†’](https://dpsg.deity.cloud/#/Management/EnvironmentPaymentProviderController_stripe_create)


```json
{
  "publicKey": "string", // Secret
  "secretKey": "string", // Secret
  "testMode": "boolean"
}
```

To get your public &amp; secret keys you must have a [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard).  Please ensure `testMode` is set to true when using test credentials.

To retrieve your credentials, log into your Stripe account and navigate to the **Developers** section ([direct link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)). Make sure to enable 'Test mode' if you want to use test credentials ([direct link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)).


### `publicKey`

The public key can be found in the **Developers** section under in the subsection **API keys**. It is labeled `Publishable key` in the `Standard keys` section and starts with `pk_`.

### `secretKey`

The secret key can be found in the **Developers** section under in the subsection **API keys**. It is labeled `Secret key` in the `Standard keys` section and 
starts with `sk_`.
