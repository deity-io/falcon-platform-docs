## Adyen Configuration

The easiest way to configure Adyen is by using `dcloud` CLI and the `dcloud payments:provider:configure` command. If you want to configure it manually, this can be achieved using [this endpoint](https://dpsg.deity.cloud/#/Management/EnvironmentPaymentProviderController_adyen_create)

```json
{
  "merchantAccount": "string",
  "apiKey": "string", // Private
  "clientKey": "string", // Private
  "hmacKey": "string", // Private
  "testMode": "boolean"
}
```

To get your client, HMAC &amp; API keys you must have a [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com/) account. Please ensure `testMode` is set to true when using test credentials.

### `merchantAccount`

You can get this from your Adyen account under `Account -> Merchant Accounts`

### `apiKey`

You can get this from your Adyen account under `Developer -> API Credentials` then select `ws`.

### `clientKey`

You can get this from your Adyen account under `Developer -> API Credentials` then select `ws`.

### `hmacKey`

This is used for processing the webhooks from Adyen. DPSG uses this when payments are updated.
Read below how to obtain it.

:::note Allowed Origins
Adyen requires you to set allowed origins so the frontend components can be rendered. You can see these when managing the API keys.

You can get your HMAC key when configuring your webhook. To do this, log into your Adyen account and visit `Developers -> Webhooks` in the left hand navigation.

From their you can set up a `Standard Notification` webhook with the following configuration:

**General**

- Server configuration: `https://dpsg.{region}.deity.cloud/api/payment/webhook/{organization}/{project}/{environment}/adyen` (replacing `{region}`, `{organization}`, `{project}` and `{environment}` with your details). If your region is Europe it will be omitted and the base url will be (https://dpsg.deity.cloud).
- Method: `JSON`
- Encryption protocol: `TLSv1.3`
- Events: select all

**Security**

In "Security" section - generate a new HMAC key (make sure to store it in a safe place - you will need it for configuring the provider on DPSG).

**Additional Settings**

- Make sure to select all "Additional Settings" (it will be helpful for future updates of DPSG)
- Later navigate to `Developers -> Additional data`, make sure to enable `Toggle all fields`.

:::note Test your webhook
You should be able to test this and get a 200 ok response from within the Adyen dashboard.
