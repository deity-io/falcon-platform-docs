Getting started with an existing payment provider is simple. If you want to do this manually you can do this using `npm` or `yarn` from your `server` directory. If you're using our **BigCommerce** integration this can be done through the **BigCommerce** admin.

## 1. Add the packages you need

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">


**Don't include the providers you're not using**

```bash
npm install @deity/falcon-payments
npm install @deity/falcon-payments-env
npm install @deity/falcon-payments-endpoints
npm install @deity/falcon-payments-stripe
npm install @deity/falcon-payments-mollie
npm install @deity/falcon-payments-plain
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">


**Don't include the providers you're not using**

```bash
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments-env
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments-endpoints
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments-stripe
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments-mollie
yarn add @deity/falcon-payments-plain
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 2. Create a payment provider account

Each payment provider will require different credentials to get started. Normally an `api key` and an `api secret`. You'll need these to get started.

## 3. Configure your payment components

In your DEITY Middleware configuration files you can configure both your endpoints (for Webhooks) and your payment components.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "payments": {
      "package": "@deity/falcon-payments",
      "config": {
        "webhookBaseUrl": "https://myBackEndUrl.com",
        "webhookUrl": "/falcon-payments/webhook",
        "redirectBaseUrl": "https://myAwesomeWebsite.com",
        "redirectUrl": "/checkout/pending",
        "skipSurcharges": false,
        "providers": {
          "stripe": {
            "enabled": true,
            "package": "@deity/falcon-payments-stripe",
            "config": {
              ... // API credentials go here
            }
          },
          "mollie": {
            "enabled": true,
            "package": "@deity/falcon-payments-mollie",
            "config": {
              ... // API credentials go here
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "payments": {
      "package": "@deity/falcon-payments-endpoints",
      "config": {
        "protocol": "https",
        "host": "https",
        "url": "/falcon-payments/webhook",
        "paymentsComponent": "payments" // This indicates we are using the payments compoent, that in turn is using @deity/falcon-payments
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Integrate with your client side app

The final step is to add your method UI components to DEITY PWA Frontend and start processing payments. The best place to start is using one of our examples apps, or reading our [integration guide](integration).
