Before you start you'll need the following:

- A Falcon Platform account. <a href="https://deity.io/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact our support team</a> to get an account setup. If you're using our **BigCommerce** integration you can [set up and account](/docs/platform/integration/bigcommerce/getting-started) through our app.
- An [NPM auth token](npm) to access packages from <a href="https://npm.deity.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://npm.deity.io</a>. You can get this from your admin panel.

## Technical requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (>=12)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (>=1.22)

:::note Falcon Tests are ran against major Node versions - 12 and 14.
We recommend that you use one of the above versions. These are LTS versions of Node and thus will be supported for a longer period.
