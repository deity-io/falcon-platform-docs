## Production mode

If you want to run your app in production mode first you'll need to build the app.

`yarn build:prod` (`npm build:prod`) then start the ap by running `yarn start:prod` (`npm start:prod`).

## Testing your app

To run all your tests run `yarn test` (`npm test`).

## App size

If you want to see the size of your app you can run `yarn size` (`npm size`).
