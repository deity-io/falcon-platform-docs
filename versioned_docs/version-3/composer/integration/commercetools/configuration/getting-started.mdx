## Prerequisite

Before you get started you'll need a Commercetools store and have access to the admin panel.

## Configuring Falcon Middleware
Using our example project, `demo-v3` you will have Commercetools support without having to do any custom development.

If you're using another demo, you can just install `@deity/falcon-commercetools-module` (add it to `server/package.json`) and enable it in configuration file (`server/config/default.json`) and assign to shop extension:

```json
  "modules": {
    ...
    "commercetools": {
      "module": "@deity/falcon-commercetools-module",
      "config": {
        "region": "",
        "projectKey": "",
        "url": "",
        "authUrl": "",
        "clientId": "",
        "secret": ""
      }
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    ...
    "shop": {
      "package": "@deity/falcon-shop-extension",
      "module": "commercetools"
    }
    ...
  }
```

Use your `server/config/local.json` (for local development) or your `environment variables` (for production setup) to the sensitive data where needed.

Replace values below with values applicable for your store.

```json
  "modules": {
    "commercetools": {
      "config": {
        "region": "australia-southeast1.gcp",
        "projectKey": "sandbox-au",
        "url": "https://api.australia-southeast1.gcp.commercetools.com",
        "authUrl": "https://auth.australia-southeast1.gcp.commercetools.com",
        "clientId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "secret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      }
    }
  }
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are mapped directly to the configuration option, so it's recommended to use these when setting up production deployment (and of course these can be used in development mode).
To set these variables in deployed environments, you can make use of the `dcloud env:var:set` command in our CLI tool.

- `COMMERCETOOLS_REGION`
- `COMMERCETOOLS_PROJECT_KEY`
- `COMMERCETOOLS_URL`
- `COMMERCETOOLS_AUTH_URL`
- `COMMERCETOOLS_CLIENT_ID`
- `COMMERCETOOLS_SECRET`
