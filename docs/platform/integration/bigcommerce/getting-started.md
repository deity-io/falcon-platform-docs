## Prerequisites
Before you get started you'll need a BigCommerce store and have access to the admin panel.

</a>

The first thing you'll need to do is visit the [BigCommerce App Store](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/deity-falcon-pwa-storefront/) and download our app.

## 2. Setup our app

Once you've added our app you can configure it.  From the BigCommerce admin panel visit the Apps -> My Apps section and select the **Falcon PWA** app.

Once you're viewing the app click **install**.

  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}

Our app will need to have access to some areas of your store to work. You'll need to agree to this to continue.

### ii. Start your DEITY Falcon account setup

Once you've agreed to allow our app the BigCommerce permissions it needs you be show a splash screen allowing you to [view a demo store**](#demo) so you can get to know Falcon Platform a little better. You'll also be giving the option to **'Get DEITY Falcon'**.  Click that to continue with your setup.

The next steps will take you through creating an account with us.

We offer various price plans, once you've chosen the plan that's right for you, you can continue to add your company / personal details.

### iiii. Add your personal details

You'll now be given the option to add your personal details, we'll use these as part of your invoice.

The final step of your account setup is adding your payment details.

  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}

If setup is successful a BigCommerce token will be generated and you'll be shown your BigCommerce / Falcon Platform dashboard.

## 3. Your dashboard.

You'll be able to manage your Falcon Platform account from within your BigCommerce admin panel.

<img

  alt="BigCommerce admin panel"
  width="200"
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}
/>

From here you'll be able to change personal detail, subscription and payment information and link your site to a live URL (Custom URLs are not available for **sandbox** accounts).

When you load up your dashboard you'll see a link to your new Falcon PWA store.

  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}
/>

:::note New account?
If you've just set up your account it might take a few minutes before your site is available.
:::

## 4. Connecting your code repository

Your site will be currently setup using our example app. 

If you don't already have an Falcon Client app in a code repository you'll need to create one [link here].

You repository should have the `client` folder in its `root` directory.

:::note Do you have an Enterprise account?
If you have an Enterprise account your **Falcon Server** instance should also be in the same code repository. with `client` and `server` directories in the root.
:::

### i. Accessing our NPM packages

To access our private packages you'll need to use your **NPM Token** and **NPM Username**, this can be found from the `Falcon Client` tab.

You can log into [deity.npm.io](https://npm.deity.io/) to view these pacakges.

To have access to the packages for local development you can follow (these steps)[/docs/platform/getting-started/npm/].

<img
  src="/img/docs/platform/bigcommerce/npm-token.png"
  alt="BigCommerce admin panel - NPM token"
  width="300"
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}
/>

### ii. Create your app

Once you have access to our packages you'll be able to create your app using `npx @deity/create-falcon-app --example demo-v2 [YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME]`. For more information about creating an app follow [these instructions](/docs/platform/getting-started/create).

### iii. Connect your app

The last step is to connect your app so it's being used by your Falcon Cloud account. If you visit the the `Falcon Client` tab you'll see information about **Authorising** Cloud to have access to your repository and adding a **Webhook** so cloud can listen for changes (so your Cloud instance knows when you push code).

You can see detailed docs for this step [here](/docs/platform/getting-started/repository).

## 5. Local development

When developing your app locally you'll want to connect your Falcon Client app to Falcon Server, which in turn will connect to BigCommerce.

This can be done by adding your Falcon Server credentials to your `client/config/local.json` file. You can find out more about configurations [here](/docs/platform/configuration/overview).

Add the following code to your `local.json` file, replacing `[YOUR_SITE_URL]` with your site URL.

```json
  
{
  "graphqlUrl": "[YOUR_SITE_URL]/graphql",
}
```

## 6. Falcon Cloud + Deployments

Falcon Cloud comes as part of Falcon Platform and is where your site is hosted. To manage deployments you can use our [DCloud CLI tool](/docs/platform/cloud/installation).  You'll need an **access token** to log into using DCloud. This can be found in the `Falcon Server` tab.

<img
  src="/img/docs/platform/bigcommerce/falcon-server.png"
  alt="BigCommerce admin panel - falcon server tab"
  width="500"
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "block" }}
/>


## 7. Adding integrations

If you want to add other integrations such as **Algolia** or **Wordpress** information can be found in the integrations tab.


## **Demo Store

This demo store will **NOT** pull in your products at this stage and should only be used as a reference to the features available. From here you'll be able to chat to our support team if you have any questions.
