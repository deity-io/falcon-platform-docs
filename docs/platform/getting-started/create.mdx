## Create Falcon App

To generate a new application based on Falcon Platform you can use our CLI tool, **create falcon app**.

:::note Using the new theme?
By default the demo based on "demo-v2" assumes it's connected to a **BigCommerce** instance, which uses **Algolia** and **Stripe**. Without these credentials the application will not start (you'll see the errors in the console). The old theme will, by default, be connected to our demo **Magento 2** and **Wordpress** instances.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn create @deity/falcon-app <project-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate a Falcon site into a directory with the name of your projects (`<project-name>`).

**Regular Project** 
```
project-name/
 |- client
```

**Enterprise / Full Project** 
```
project-name/
 |- client
 |- server
```

### Options

- **`--example <name-of-example>`** The example flag is used to define which example we want to start with. The options are `demo-v1`(default) and `demo-v2`.
  `demo-v1` by default connects to a demo **Magento 2** and **Wordpress** instance. To use the <a href="https://demo.deity.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest demo</a> use `demo-v2`. This requires you to have your own **BigCommerce**, **Algolia** and **Stripe** accounts.

```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app --example demo-v2 <project-name>
```

- **`--full`** To generate **Falcon Server** use the `--full` flag. You will only be able to deploy Falcon Server changes if you're on an Enterprise plan.


```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app --full <project-name>
```

## Configuring Falcon Client

:::note Running Falcon Server Locally?
If you're an Enterprise customer and running Falcon Server locally you can skip this step and connect to Falcon Server using the default settings.
:::

Before you can start your app you'll need to configure Falcon Client to point to Falcon Server. 

### 1. Create a local.json file

Create a `local.json` file in your `client/config/` direcotry. This file is ignored by `git` and should **not** be committed. 

### 2. Add your details.

Add the following code to your `local.json` file, replacing `[YOUR_SITE_URL]` with your site URL.

```json
  
{
  "graphqlUrl": "[YOUR_SITE_URL]/graphql",
}
```

## Starting your app

### Sandbox / Production customers

To get your app started you'll need to start (and keep running) **Falcon Client**.

In a terminal window go into the client directory (`cd client/`) and run the start command.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

**Client**
```bash
cd client/
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once these have started, visit <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:3000</a> to see your app.

### Enterprise customers

If you're on an Enterprise plan and have access to **Falcon Server** you may also want to run this locally. 

By default **Falcon Server** runs on `http://localhost:4000` and uses `http://localhost:4000/graphql` for it's graphQl endpoint.

As well as having **Falcon Client** running you'll need to open a new terminal window and run the start command in the `server` directory.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

**Server**
```bash
cd server/
npm start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

**Server**
```bash
cd server/
yarn start
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
