`DynamicRouteResolver` handles dynamic route resolution for the client application.
When a user goes to a page that is not defined in React routing - then the client will ask the back-end for the type of content for that particular url:

- It asks every extension to get "fetch URL priority" from the assigned API DataSource instance
- It sorts API DataSource instances that are able to determine dynamic content type by their "priority"
- It calls `fetchUrl` method on every available API DataSource until it gets a proper response

## Example

The simplest example is handling content from shop and blog. Let's say we want to resolve content for `/sport.html`

```js
class Magento2Api {
    getFetchUrlPriority(url) {
        // if url ends with .html then it's highly possible that it should be handed by shop
        // because it might be a product page under url generated by Magento
        return url.endsWith('.html') ? ApiUrlPriority.HIGH : ApiUrlPriority.NORMAL;
    }

    fetchUrl(obj, args, context, info) {
        // implementation of the resolver
    }
}
```

```js
class WordpressApi {
    getFetchUrlPriority(url) {
        // return just static value so others can be higher or lower
        return ApiUrlPriority.NORMAL;
    }

    fetchUrl(obj, args, context, info) {
        // implementation of the resolver
    }
}
```

`DynamicRouteResolver` will try to call `getFetchUrlPriority(url)` method for both extensions:

- ShopExtension/Magento2Api will return `ApiUrlPriority.HIGH`
- BlogExtension/WordpressApi will return `ApiUrlPriority.NORMAL`

So in that case `DynamicRouteResolver` will call `ShopExtension.fetchUrl()` first, if that call returns `null`,
it will call `BlogExtension.fetchUrl()` second.

By **default** the API priority order is the order they are added in your `server/config/default.json` file. With the first API being checked first. If the priorities are the same this order will be used.

We provide these orders:

**`@deity/falcon-server-env/src/types.ts`**
```tsx
export enum ApiUrlPriority {
  HIGHEST = 1,
  HIGH = 2,
  NORMAL = 3,
  LOW = 4,
  LOWEST = 5,
  OFF = 0
}
```

## DynamicRouteResolver result structure

The correct response must match the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "path": "/foo.html",
    "type": "foo-type",
    "redirect": false
}
```

- `id` - must represent a unique ID for your back-end
- `path` - must represent a canonical path for your entity (this will be used for a possible redirection situation)
- `type` - must represent a unique entity type that will be later used by `DynamicRoute` component on `falcon-client`
- `redirect` - must set a flag whether the given URL must be redirected to the `path` address (to ensure canonical URL)

## Requirements

If any extension should handle dynamic routing it should implement both methods:

- `getFetchUrlPriority(url)` - accepts url (`string`) that should be resolved and returns the priority (`number`) for the extension
- `fetchUrl(obj, args, context, info)` - fetches the data from the remote source or performs any other async logic to determine
the type of the given url and returns a correct result or `null` (if the given URL is not determined by your back-end)
