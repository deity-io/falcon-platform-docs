### Introduction
The Commercetools Client `ctpClient` allows you to connect to the SDK in the name of user or integration. The [Commercetools Session `ctpSession`](./ctp-session) is used for authentication.

### API root
You can make use of the by Commercetools [TypeScript SDK](https://commercetools.github.io/nodejs/sdk) through the `apiRoot`. Our `ctpClient` provides two methods to fetch a pre-configured client that can be use to create the `apiRoot` in which all required authorization and session refreshing are handled:
- **`getIntegrationClient()`**
To make requests in the name of the [commercetools project](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/projects), use the `getCustomerClient`. This is for all requests where a signed-in user is not required.
- **`getCustomerClient()`**
To make requests in name of the customer, use the `customerApiRoot`.

#### Authorization
Requests made to Commercetools API are authenticated through auth middlewares. In our `ctpClient` the [createAuthMiddlewareWithExistingToken](https://commercetools.github.io/nodejs/sdk/api/sdkMiddlewareAuth.html#createauthmiddlewarewithexistingtokenauthorization-options) middleware is used, where a `Bearer` token is set to the request header.

#### Authorization Token
When you don't need a full `apiRoot`, but you want access to integration or customer tokens, you can directly request them through the `ctpClient`:

```typescript
const integrationToken = await this.ctpClient.getIntegrationToken();
const customerToken = await this.ctpClient.getCustomerToken();
```
:::caution
Although you can also access the customerToken directly from the `ctpSession`, we strongly advice to use the asynchronous method as shown above. Only then you are sure the returned token is validated and refreshed when necessary.

### Integration API root

#### Scopes
Our integration client only works correctly if the correct scopes has been assigned to it. Make sure you check the following when generating your accessToken in the Commercetools dashboard:
- `view_project_settings`
- `view_categories`
- `view_published_products`
- `view_products`
- `manage_orders`
- `manage_payments`
- `manage_customers`
- `view_customers`

#### Example for fetching and using the integration API root
```ts
@injectable()
class ExampleIntegrationDatasource {
    constructor(@inject('CtpClient') protected ctpClient: CtpClient) {}

    async findById(id: string): Promise<CtpCategory> {
        const integrationApiRoot = createApiBuilderFromCtpClient(await this.ctpClient.integration(), this.config.url);
        const { body: category } = await integrationApiRoot
            .withProjectKey({ projectKey: this.config.projectKey })
            .categories()
            .withId({ ID: id })
            .get()
            .execute();

        return category;
    }
}
```
## Customer API root
When using `this.ctpClient.getCustomerClient()` you don't need to worry about refreshing sessions. Our `ctpClient` will refresh the `CtpAuthToken` when needed and store fresh token in our [session](./ctp-session).

#### Scopes
When a customer authenticates through our middleware, the following set of scopes will be requested:
- `view_stores`
- `view_orders`
- `view_payments`
- `view_shopping_lists`
- `manage_my_profile`
- `manage_orders`
- `manage_customers`
- `manage_my_orders`
- `manage_my_payments`
- `manage_my_shopping_lists`

#### Example for fetching and using the customer API root
A cart belongs to a customer, whether this is a signed in customer or a guest filling his cart, we will interact with the API in the same way through the `customerApiRoot`.

```ts
@injectable()
class ExampleCustomerDatasource {
    constructor(@inject('CtpClient') protected ctpClient: CtpClient) {}

    async myCart() {
        const customerApiRoot = createApiBuilderFromCtpClient(await this.ctpClient.getCustomerClient(), this.config.url);
        const { body: cart } = await customerApiRoot
            .withProjectKey({ projectKey: this.config.projectKey })
            .me()
            .activeCart()
            .get()
            .execute();

        return cart;
    }
}
```
