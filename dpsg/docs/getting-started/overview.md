Using DPSG can be broken down into 3 main sections.

## 1. Configuring things within DPSG itself. 

This involves creating an environment and enabling payment providers and payment methods.

This configuration can be done entirely using our `dcloud` CLI tool.

## 2. Connecting your APP to your DPSG environment

To use DPSG in your app you need to connect to it. For this you just need to add a few config changes to your remote or local apps config.

## 3. Using DPSG within your app

Our demo apps are already setup to use DPSG so this section should only really be needed for custom integrations or projects with very bespoke functionality.
