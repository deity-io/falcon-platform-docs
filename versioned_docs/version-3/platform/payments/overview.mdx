Payments can be handled in 2 ways, either via your shop or using our payments package, [`@deity/falcon-payments`](falcon-payments/overview).

We **highly recommend** using [`@deity/falcon-payments`](falcon-payments/overview) as this will provide the most flexibility,
ensure your server doesn't need to be PCI-compliant (all payments are handled on the client-side) and we are continuously adding
support for new payment providers.

### Payment using your shop

Payment methods can be retrieved from your shop backend. Falcon can simply display a UI and pass order details to the backend via Falcon Server. These are processed using your shops backend and NOT by Falcon.

### Payments using Falcon Payments (Recommended)

Falcon Payments package acts as a middleware and handles all payment processing via APIs directly communicating with payment providers. This then sends payment statuses to your shops API via webhooks.
