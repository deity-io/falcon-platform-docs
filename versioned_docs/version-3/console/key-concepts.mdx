    <img src="/img/icons/activity.svg" />
    <h4>Platform Usage</h4>
    <p>For each organization project, Deity offers pre-paid subscriptions that include a large number of GraphQL client requests. Once you go over this threshold, you’ll be billed surcharges separately based on the number of incoming client requests.</p>

    <img src="/img/icons/cloud.svg" />
    <h4>Environments</h4>
    <p>For each project, Deity offers three Deity Cloud environments to start with; Test, acceptance & production. If you need more environments for your project, you can always request more.</p>

<div className="flex mb80 brighten">
  <Card to="/console/builds-deployments/builds">
    <img src="/img/icons/cpu.svg" />
    <h4>Builds</h4>
    <p>A build is a full build of a particular commit. This is not accessible unless it's deployed. Having builds for each of your commits means it's near instant to update your environments.</p>
  </Card>
  <Card to="/console/builds-deployments/deployments">
    <img src="/img/icons/deployment.svg" />
    <h4>Deployments</h4>
    <p>Deployments are when a build has been pushed to an environment. You can deploy these builds to one of your environments.</p>
