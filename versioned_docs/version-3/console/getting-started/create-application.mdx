Now that you have access to our packages, letâ€™s create a Deity template application. You can choose from three of our templates:

<code>demo-v1 : template with preconfigured Magento 2 store and a WordPress blog</code><br/><br/>

<code>demo-v2 : template based on a BigCommerce store and Algolia search engine</code><br/><br/>

<code>demo-v3 : template based on a Commercetools store and Contentful blog</code><br/><br/>

You can generate one of these template apps by running the following command in your terminal


```bash
npx @deity/create-falcon-app --full <demo version> <project-name> 
```

A new project will be created into the directory <code>&lt;project-name&gt;</code>. The file structure is straightforward:

```bash
project-name/
	|-client
	|-server
```

You can run the project on your local machine. Note that you will need to run both apps separately as follows:


```bash
cd client
yarn start
```

```bash
cd server
yarn start
```
