# Key concepts of Payment Orchestrator
<p className="desc pb20">Payment Orchestrator (DPSG) is a managed and hosted service that handles interactions between Commerce Composer and payment providers.

    <h3>Payment orchestration</h3>
    <p>
    Payment Orchestrator is available to all Deity Platform users. It acts as a middleman between payment providers and Commerce Composer.
    </p>
    <p>
    It exposes various REST API endpoints for doing things like querying payment methods, making payments and storing payment methods.
    </p>
    <p>
    Alongside this it always exposes a message queue that Commerce Composer subscribes to. This publishes events such as payment updates after refunds.
