The Deity platform comes with an automated build and deploy system out of the box. Once you’ve linked your repository, Deity will create a new build of your branch’ code after every git push event. You can deploy a successful build to any environment with the click of a button.

You can visit the following builds and deployments topics. They are available depending on your assigned user role.
