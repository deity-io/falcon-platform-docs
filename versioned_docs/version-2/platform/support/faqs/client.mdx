<Accordion title="Can I use NextJS">
  Unfortunately, Falcon-Client (the frontend app) cannot be used together with NextJs.  NextJs uses its own template/routing system, which is incompatible with ours.  Falcon-Server (data/graphql server app) could be used as a middleware between Spree backend and your frontend. It could be even used to provide data for your NextJs frontend (depending on how you want to organize your whole setup).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I access configuration values?">
  This works differently for DEITY PWA Frontend and DEITY Middleware. Configuration information can be found <Link to="/docs/platform/configuration/overview">here</Link>.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Offline support doesn't seem to be working...">
  Our service worker, that provides offline support is only used in production mode. If you're running your app in development `yarn start` rather than `yarn start:prod` offline mode won't work.
