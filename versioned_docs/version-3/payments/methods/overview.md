# Payment methods

Every payment provider has a specific set of payment methods that it supports. The available methods are listed in the respective `Payment Providers` documentation page. Some payment methods are available for more than one payment provider, which allows you to choose the provider that better fits your needs.


## Payment method configuration

The easiest way to configure a payment method is by using `dcloud` CLI and the `dcloud payments:method:configure` command. If you want to configure it manually, this can be achieved using [this endpoint â†’](https://dpsg.deity.cloud/#/Payment%20Method/EnvironmentPaymentMethodController_add).
